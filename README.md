# Employee Directory

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Technologies used
This project uses react with axios api calls to get the sample employee data. It also utilized bootstrap for styling as well as CSS. 

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Zack for helping me with getting the data from the API call to render on the page. Thanks to my tutor for helping with the search function.
